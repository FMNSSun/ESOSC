1 About ESOSC
-------------

The Esoteric Standard Committee (usually referred to as ESOSC) issues esolang
related standards to strive for a standardization of esoteric programming
languages and esolang related works.  


2 EUIN
------

The ESOSC Unique Identification number uniquely identifies (usually referred to
as EUIN) a standard with respect to specific versions of certain standards.  


2.1 Format 
==========

The format of an EUIN is as follows:  

<EUIN> ::= 
  `ESOSC' <hyph> <year> <hyph> <prefix> <number> [ <hyph>`R' <number> ]
<hyph> ::= `-' 
<number> ::= <digit> | <digit> <number> 
<digit> ::= `0'|`1'|`2'|`3'|`4'|`5'|`6'|`7'|`8'|`9' 
<year> ::= <digit> <digit> <digit> <digit> 
<prefix> ::= `D' | `A' | `O' 

 
prefix denotes the state the standard is in. D refers to a draft, A to an
approved standard and O marks obsolete standards. The optional -R... part
denotes a revision number of a standard. Further the EUIN encodes the year
of first issue and a number that is successively increased with every new
standard to ensure uniqueness. The EUIN doesnâ€™t change except for the prefix
and revision number once a standard changes state. Revision numbers are
successively increased with new revisions of a standard. Revision numbers
shall be avoided for approved standards.  


3 Approval of standards 
-----------------------

For a standard to be approved at least three members of the ESOSC have to
approve it without having been bribed, forced, blackmailed or influenced by
drugs, alcohol or similar substances to do so. 


4 Obsoletion
------------

Standards may be marked as obsolete once the ESOSC finds that it is no longer
appropriate to use or has been completely replaced by another standard and can
not recommend using the old standard any longer. Marking a standard as
obsolete requires approval of at least three members of the ESOSC. 


5 Drafts
--------

Any member of the ESOSC is allowed to submit drafts for approval.
Any non-member of the ESOSC is allowed to request that the ESOSC should work
on a new standard and may submit suggestions or proposals for standards to
the ESOSC.  


6 Revisions 
-----------

A new revision of an approved standard is put into the draft state and
requires the usual approval process taking place. Revisions of standards in
draft state are not affected by this. The ESOSC is allowed to correct grammar,
orthographical or similar mistakes without requiring a new revision.  


7 New members
-------------

For a non-member to become a member he or she has to pass a vote. To pass the
vote 2/3 of all existing members must vote to accept her or him as a new
member.
