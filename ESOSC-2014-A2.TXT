  ESOTERIC STANDARD COMMITTEE
     Normalized Brainfuck
     ESOSC-2014-A2

This standard has been approved by the following members of the ESOSC:
 * nortti
 * Taneb

1 Brainfuck
-----------

Brainfuck is a well known esoteric programming language created by Urban
Müller which operates on a tape (an array of memory cells). A pointer 
dictates which cell on the tape a command reads or writes [1].
Different brainfuck implementations handle characters that are not commands
differently. The ESOSC defines a normal form for brainfuck programs which all
standard conform implementations shall accept.


2 Normalized Brainfuck
----------------------

Normalized Brainfuck (NBF) defines a strict grammar to ease development of
brainfuck implementations. NBF programs contain no whitespaces or comments
and thus may only contain valid commands.

2.1 Normal Form
===============

Shown below in figure [FNF] is the grammar of the normal form (NF). 
If a brainfuck program conforms to this grammar it is NBF conform.

    [FNF]

    <S> ::= <A><S> | λ
    <A> ::= ‘+’|‘-’|‘>’|‘<’|‘.’|‘,’|‘[’<S>‘]’

    [/FNF]

A brainfuck implementation must be able to accept brainfuck programs in normal
form. Optionally it may issue a warning if it is confronted with an
unnormalized brainfuck program or even reject such unnormalized brainfuck
programs.
